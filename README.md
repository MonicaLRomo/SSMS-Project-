# SSMS-Project-
Creation of a small database on SSMS and a generated file done on SSRS.
This was made for a fictional field technician business who had a customer with a couple locations. I was able to generate a file from the database I created on SSMS. 
Technologies used were SSMS, SSRS, and Visio.
You will be able to run this project on your SSMS.
